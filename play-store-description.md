**Stop Sleeping Through Your Alarms**

WakeMind is not just another alarm app - it's a cognitive alarm clock designed to ensure you actually wake up. By requiring you to engage your brain with interactive challenges, WakeMind guarantees you're alert and ready to start your day.

**How It Works**

When your alarm rings, you can't just hit snooze or dismiss it. Instead, you must complete one of three brain-engaging challenges:

🧮 **Math Challenge** - Solve arithmetic problems with customizable difficulty
🎨 **Memory Challenge** - Repeat color patterns in this Simon Says-style game
🧩 **Logic Challenge** - Complete sequences and identify patterns

Only after successfully completing the challenge will your alarm turn off. This ensures you're mentally alert and prevents you from falling back asleep.

**Key Features**

✓ **Smart Alarms** - Create unlimited alarms with custom schedules
✓ **Three Challenge Types** - Math, Memory, and Logic puzzles
✓ **Adjustable Difficulty** - Choose the challenge level that works for you
✓ **Backup Protocols** - Snooze protection and wake check notifications
