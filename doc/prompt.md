DAILY BUILD IN PUBLIC SUMMARY (NO PRODUCT NAME)

> I’m documenting my build-in-public journey and sharing daily progress updates on **Twitter/X and Bluesky**.
>
> You have access to the project’s git repository and should **fetch the commits automatically**.
>
> Your task:
>
> 1. Retrieve all commits from **the previous day up to the most recent commit**
> 2. Read and understand the changes
> 3. Identify only **meaningful progress** (ignore trivial refactors, formatting, or dependency noise)
> 4. Write a **short daily update** suitable for public sharing
>

>
> ## Critical Rules
>
> **1. Do NOT mention the product name (“WakeMind”) anywhere in the output.**
> Refer to it only as _“the project”_, _“the app”_, or implicitly.
>
> **2. Strictly respect character limits for each platform.**
>
> - **Twitter/X:** maximum **280 characters**
> - **Bluesky:** maximum **300 characters**
>
> The output **must fit within these limits without truncation**.
>
> ---
>
> ## Writing Guidelines
>
> - Professional, calm, builder tone
> - No hype, no emojis
> - Focus on **product progress**, not code-level details
> - Clear, concise language suitable for technical and product audiences
>
> ---
>
> ## Output Format
>
> ### Twitter/X version
>
> Single paragraph or 2–3 short sentences
>
> ### Bluesky version
>
> Slightly more descriptive; bullets allowed if within the character limit
>
> ---
>
> ## Context (internal, do not mention publicly)
>
> The app is a **cognitive wake-up system** focused on performance, reliability, and UX clarity.
>
> Generate the summary automatically based on the latest commits.
